# Oregon-SB-Map-Project

Created with CodeSandbox

I was brought on to help work on this project by a company called Terrapin Data in the Spring of 2020. I utilized a large spreadsheet of school board data collected by a Political Science student at the UO. I took this information and formatted it into GeoJSON using Mapbox and QGIS. I then imported the map into this React App using the Mapbox API.

The project uses React Router to switch between multiple pages, and material-ui for the styling. We ended up having to ditch the project after 3 months as we fell outside of the timeline for the voting season.

This project was developed entirely on my own and is a great example of how much I can learn in three months despite my school/work obligations.
